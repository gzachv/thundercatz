Code Coverage Read me:

We ran code coverage on our entire test bench. The resulting reports are included in this deliverable. 

The code coverage results presented in this deliverable report. The first time we ran code coverage
 (results in code_coverage_results.png and coverage_report.txt) we saw that the branch coverage for the band scale
module was at 50%. On further inspection, we saw that the saturation was not being tested by our testbench. 

To fix this lack of coverage, we ran our testbench with a variety of other analog_in files. We made sure to max out
all of the analog.dat channels. This assured that the saturation values would be hit by the testbench.
